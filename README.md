# Parallel-Algorithms
A Brief Report on Parallel Algorithms and their Applications

Introduction:
The parallel algorithm is an approach to solve real-world problems as well as
high-level complex data management problems with ease & high efficiency. It
works by dividing a bigger problem into sub smaller problems and then
simultaneously executing the problem on different processors and combining
the data into a final result.
Every day we face many task & challenges which requires high volume if data
processing and by following the regular approach we cannot solve these
tasks or even if some algorithm manages to do so then it will be a big
challenge for the CPU to process and generate the Result.
This is where Parallel algorithm plays its role. These types of algorithms are
carefully designed to manage a large volume of data and then rather than
putting everything onto a single CPU, it divides the problem into subtask that
runs the same algorithm but on a smaller scale with a lesser volume of data
and executes all the subtasks simultaneously on every CPU core. In other
words, multiple processors are used to running the same program with
instructions divided across. Then collect the result and generate the final
result for the task.
As a result, the running time of the program is smaller than the number of
instructions executed.
This report describes the impact of such parallel algorithms on some
problems that are common and useful in our everyday life.
